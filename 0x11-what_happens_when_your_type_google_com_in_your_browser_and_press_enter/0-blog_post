What Happens When You Type `https://www.google.com` in Your Browser and Press Enter?

When you type `https://www.google.com` into your browser and press Enter, a complex series of events unfolds behind the scenes. This process involves multiple technologies working together to ensure you get the search results you’re looking for. In this post, we’ll break down each step of this workflow, from DNS requests to database queries.
1.	DNS Request: A Deep Dive
When you enter `https://www.google.com` in your browser, a crucial first step is to resolve this domain name into an IP address. This process is handled by the Domain Name System (DNS). Here’s a detailed look at what happens during a DNS request:
•	Local Cache Check
Browser Cache: The browser first checks its own DNS cache to see if it has recently resolved `www.google.com`. If it has, it uses the cached IP address to proceed with the connection.
Operating System Cache: If the browser cache does not have the information, the operating system’s DNS cache is checked next. This cache stores DNS records that were recently queried by any application on your computer.
•	DNS Resolver
If the information is not cached locally, the request is sent to a DNS resolver, often provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). The resolver is a server designed to handle DNS queries.
Recursive Query: The resolver performs a recursive query on your behalf. It starts the process of resolving the domain name into an IP address by querying multiple DNS servers.
•	Root DNS Servers
Query to Root Servers: The resolver sends a query to one of the root DNS servers. Root servers are authoritative for the top-level domain (TLD) and don’t have specific IP addresses but know where to find them.
Root Server Response: The root server responds with a referral to the appropriate TLD server for `.com` domains. This is a list of servers that are responsible for `.com` domain names.
•	Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers
Query to TLD Servers: The resolver then queries a TLD server, which handles `.com` domains in this case.
TLD Server Response: The TLD server responds with a referral to the authoritative DNS server for the domain `google.com`.
•	Authoritative DNS Server
Query to Authoritative Server: The resolver queries Google’s authoritative DNS server, which is responsible for `google.com`.
Authoritative Response: The authoritative DNS server provides the IP address for `www.google.com`. It may also include additional DNS records such as MX (Mail Exchange) records or CNAME (Canonical Name) records.
•	Caching
Caching by Resolver: The DNS resolver caches the IP address for `www.google.com` to speed up future requests. This reduces the load on DNS servers and improves performance for subsequent requests.
Caching by Browser: The IP address is also cached by the browser for future use.
•	Response to Browser
DNS Response: The IP address is sent back through the chain of servers — from the authoritative server, to the TLD server, to the root server, and finally to the DNS resolver.
Final Delivery: The DNS resolver then returns the IP address to the browser. The browser can now use this IP address to establish a connection with Google’s web server.
Additional Considerations
DNS Records: DNS responses can include various types of records:
A Records: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
AAAA Records: Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
CNAME Records: Provides an alias for a domain name.
MX Records: Indicates mail servers for the domain.
DNS Security: DNS can be vulnerable to attacks like DNS spoofing. Security measures such as DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) help protect against such threats by validating DNS responses.
2.	TCP/IP: Establishing a Connection
After obtaining the IP address for `www.google.com`, your browser needs to establish a connection with Google’s server. This is done using the TCP/IP protocol suite, which ensures that data is transmitted reliably over the internet. Let’s break down each component involved:
•	TCP Connection
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite. It ensures that data is transmitted accurately and in the correct order. Here’s how it establishes a connection:
	Three-Way Handshake: TCP uses a process known as the three-way handshake to establish a reliable connection between your browser and the server. This involves three steps:
o	SYN (Synchronize):
Client Initiates: Your browser, acting as the client, sends a SYN packet to the server. This packet contains a randomly chosen sequence number that is used to track the data being sent.
Purpose: This step signals the server that the client wants to establish a connection and provides an initial sequence number.
o	SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge):
 Server Responds: The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet. This packet acknowledges the receipt of the SYN packet by including the client’s sequence number and includes its own initial sequence number.
 Purpose: This step confirms that the server is willing to establish a connection and provides its own sequence number to track data.
o	ACK (Acknowledge):
 Client Acknowledges: Your browser sends an ACK packet back to the server. This packet acknowledges the receipt of the server’s SYN-ACK packet.
 Purpose: This final step completes the handshake, and the connection is now established. Both sides can start transmitting data.
Connection Established: After the three-way handshake, a full-duplex communication channel is established. This means that data can be sent and received simultaneously between the browser and the server.
•	IP Protocol
IP (Internet Protocol) is responsible for routing packets of data between devices on a network. Here’s how it works in the context of a TCP connection:
	Packet Routing:
o	Data Segmentation: The data to be sent from your browser is divided into smaller packets. Each packet is assigned an IP header that contains the destination IP address (the server’s IP) and other routing information.
o	Routing Packets: These packets are sent over the internet, and routers direct them to the destination IP address. Routers use the IP address to determine the best path for the packets.
	Packet Delivery:
o	Reassembly: When the packets reach the server, they are reassembled into the original data. The server processes the data and prepares a response.
o	Error Handling: If any packets are lost or corrupted during transmission, TCP handles retransmission. It ensures that all packets are received correctly and in the correct order.
	IP Versions:
i. IPv4: Most internet traffic uses IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4), which provides a 32-bit address space. This means there are about 4.3 billion unique IP addresses.
ii. IPv6: IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) provides a larger address space (128-bit), accommodating the growing number of devices connected to the internet.

3.	Firewalls: Protecting Your Connection
Firewalls are essential components in network security, acting as barriers between trusted and untrusted networks. They help protect both your local network and web servers from various types of cyber threats. Let’s explore how different types of firewalls work and their significance in the process of connecting to `www.google.com`.
1. Network Firewall
Network firewalls are deployed at the perimeter of a network to control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic. They function at different layers of the OSI model, primarily at Layer 3 (Network) and Layer 4 (Transport). Here’s how they work:

•	Packet Filtering:
	Basic Filtering: Network firewalls inspect packets based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. They allow or block packets according to predefined security rules.
	Stateless vs. Stateful: Stateless firewalls evaluate each packet independently, while stateful firewalls track the state of active connections and make decisions based on the context of the traffic.
•	Access Control:
	Rules and Policies: Network firewalls use access control lists (ACLs) to define rules that specify which traffic is permitted or denied. For example, a rule might block all incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP) except for requests from specific IP addresses.
	Network Address Translation (NAT): Firewalls can perform NAT, which hides internal IP addresses by translating them into a single public IP address. This helps protect internal network details from external threats.
•	Intrusion Detection and Prevention:
	IDS/IPS: Some network firewalls integrate Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to monitor and block suspicious activities and potential attacks.

2. Application Firewall
Application firewalls provide more granular protection by focusing on traffic specific to web applications. They operate at Layer 7 (Application) of the OSI model, inspecting the content of the traffic to detect and block malicious requests.
•	Web Application Firewall (WAF):
	Request Inspection: WAFs analyse incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests to identify and block attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other web-based threats.
	Content Filtering: They inspect the data in the request and response messages, filtering out malicious content before it reaches the application server or the client.
•	Behavioural Analysis:
	Anomaly Detection: WAFs can detect unusual patterns or behaviours in web traffic that might indicate an attack, such as a sudden surge in traffic or repeated failed login attempts.
	Rate Limiting: They can implement rate limiting to prevent abuse by controlling the number of requests from a single IP address within a specific time frame.
•	Security Policies:
	Custom Rules: WAFs can be configured with custom rules tailored to the specific needs of the application. For example, a rule might block requests that contain certain types of input or originate from known malicious IP addresses.
	Application-Specific Protection: WAFs provide protection for specific applications, addressing vulnerabilities that are unique to the application’s code and functionality.

3. The Role of Firewalls in Connection Security
•	Protecting Your Network:
	Inbound Protection: On your local network, firewalls protect your devices from external threats by blocking unauthorized access and filtering out potentially harmful traffic.
	Outbound Protection: They also monitor and control the traffic leaving your network, ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked or sent to malicious destinations.
•	Securing Web Servers:
	Preventing Attacks: On Google’s side, firewalls help defend against various types of cyberattacks, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which attempt to overwhelm servers with excessive traffic.
	Maintaining Availability: By filtering out malicious traffic, firewalls help ensure that legitimate users can access services without interruption or degradation.
•	Layered Security Approach:
	Defence-in-Depth: Firewalls are just one layer in a multi-layered security strategy. Combining network firewalls, application firewalls, and other security measures such as encryption, access controls, and regular updates creates a robust defence against a wide range of threats.

4.	HTTPS/SSL
To ensure the security and privacy of your data, HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is used, which involves SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security).
- SSL/TLS Handshake: Before data is transmitted, your browser and Google’s server perform an SSL/TLS handshake. This process involves exchanging encryption keys and establishing a secure connection.
- Encryption: All data sent between your browser and the server is encrypted, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.
5. Load-Balancer
Once the secure connection is established, your request is routed to Google’s servers. To handle millions of requests efficiently, Google uses load balancers.
- Distributing Traffic: Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed. This ensures high availability and reliability of Google’s services.
6. Web Server
Your request is then handled by a web server, which is responsible for processing HTTP requests.
- Request Handling: The web server receives your request, processes it, and sends the necessary data to the application server. In the case of Google, this involves handling complex search queries and user interactions.
7. Application Server
The application server performs the actual processing of the request.
- Processing Requests: Google’s application servers run the code that processes your search query. This might involve complex algorithms and accessing various internal services to generate relevant search results.
8. Database
The application server interacts with databases to retrieve and store data.
- Query Execution: For a search query, the application server might query databases to fetch relevant information, such as indexed web pages and user data.
- Database Optimisation: Google uses advanced database management systems to handle massive amounts of data efficiently.
In conclusion, after processing the request and retrieving the necessary data, the web server sends the response back through the same network path — via the load balancer, TCP/IP, and SSL/TLS layers — until it reaches your browser. Your browser then renders the search results page, completing the process.
